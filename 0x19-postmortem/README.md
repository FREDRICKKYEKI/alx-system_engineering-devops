**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: October 10, 2023, 14:00 UTC
  - End Time: October 11, 2023, 03:30 UTC
- **Impact:** 
  - The outage affected our e-commerce website, leading to intermittent downtime and severe performance degradation for approximately 70% of our users.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was identified as a database deadlock issue. A long-running and unoptimized database query led to resource contention, which resulted in the database server becoming unresponsive.

**Timeline:**
- **Detection Time:**
  - October 10, 2023, 14:15 UTC
- **How Detected:**
  - Monitoring alerts for increased latency and elevated error rates triggered the initial detection.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - The on-call engineer immediately started investigating the issue. Initial assumptions pointed towards a front-end code change causing excessive database queries.
- **Misleading Investigation Paths:**
  - Initially, the team suspected a code deployment as the potential cause. They spent time reviewing recent changes in the codebase, but this did not yield any leads.
- **Escalation:**
  - The incident was escalated to the database team when it became apparent that the issue was database-related and not code-related. This occurred at 15:30 UTC.
- **Resolution:**
  - The database team performed a detailed analysis and discovered that a long-running and inefficient database query was causing resource contention, leading to deadlocks. They optimized the query and introduced a rate limiter to prevent such queries from overwhelming the system. The incident was resolved at 03:30 UTC on October 11, 2023.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:**
  - The root cause was an unoptimized database query that led to deadlocks. Specifically, a poorly performing SQL query resulted in resource contention, causing the database server to become unresponsive.
- **Resolution:**
  - To address the issue, the database team optimized the query, reducing its execution time significantly. Additionally, they implemented a rate limiter to restrict the number of concurrent queries of this type. These measures prevented further deadlocks and improved database performance.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Regular code and query optimization reviews will be conducted to identify and address potential performance bottlenecks.
  - Comprehensive load testing will be performed to identify and rectify any other potential vulnerabilities.
  - Enhanced monitoring and alerting systems will be implemented to provide faster detection of similar database issues.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Optimize all critical database queries and code pathways to prevent future performance bottlenecks.
  - Implement query rate limiting to prevent excessive resource consumption.
  - Update monitoring and alerting configurations to ensure rapid incident detection.
  - Conduct a post-incident review to assess the incident response process and identify areas for further improvement.

In conclusion, the outage was caused by an unoptimized database query that led to resource contention and deadlocks. The incident was resolved by optimizing the query and implementing a rate limiter. To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will focus on code and query optimizations, load testing, enhanced monitoring, and improved incident response processes. Our commitment is to provide a more robust and reliable web stack for our users.
